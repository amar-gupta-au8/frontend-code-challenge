# Front-End Interview Test
The code is pretty basic and not overdone with the aim to keep things functional yet simple.

## The Task

The programming challenge exists in 2 parts:
* Part A: HTML + CSS
* Part B: Javascript

### PART A: HTML + CSS

* Used SCSS syntax for stylesheets as it balances readability and functionality.
* Used BEM naming convention for improved code readability.

### PART B: Javascript

Used React.JS as it enables
* Componential structure.
* Powerful management of resource files.
* Ability to scale on-demand.

## Features

* Uniform height for items for aesthetic purposes.
* Used flex for grid layout with 3 items per row and auto spacing between items. In case the items have variable height, the grid would still have uniform height rows.
* All images scaled to fit a 8:5 aspect ratio without letterboxes.
* Loader animation when fetching data.
* Folder structure for React components map to corresponding stylesheets.
* ESLint used throughout.
